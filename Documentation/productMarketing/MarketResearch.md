#Market Research

## Understand what dishes are more popular.

## Goal: 
Find users who want to experiement with recipes and identify what they care about. What dishes matter to them, what is their demographic, how do they approach experimentation? 

### Hypothesis:
* ID dishes that encourage experimentation
	* Must be complex enough to require recipes
		* Good Example: Braised short-ribs
		* Bad Example: Pizza, most people don’t follow recipes. 
	* Must require some level of precision
		* Good Example: Any baking good
		* Bad Example: Stir Fry.
	* ID dishes that have variations 
		* Good: Ramen, there are so multiple types
		* Bad: _*??????*_
* There needs to be an active enough “market” to sustain UGC
	* Dish has high search volume
	* Dish has passionate followers
		* Unsure how to determine this. (instagram posts?)

Ideas:
* Pasta
* Chicken Wings
* Acoholic Beverage
* Ribs
* Beermaking
