Wasn&rsquo;t good. Especially the short rib. Twice. Both time weren&rsquo;t good. &nbsp;Used a different recipe this time. Try to buy as many ingredients. I am a big believer in american test kitchen. Most of the recipes work for me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m an engineer. First time used another cook book&rsquo;s recipe. Second time, used ATK, was a portion problem. Had too much meat. All the braising liquid evaporated.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wanted to do it well. One of the dishes, I want a &ldquo;signature&rdquo; dish. Not that hard to do, need to control a few things. Braised short-rib. 4 tries:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Late last year somepoint</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beginning of this year</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">April</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trying again that night</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Short-rib journey.

Will modify. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sounds like he&rsquo;s done when he can consistently repeat it.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I still believe that ingredients matter the most. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c10"><a name="h.dok3keaabl1l"></a><span>Sonja Hernandez</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>Wed, Apr 16, 2014 at 1:43 PM</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Interview: Email</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I have run up against similar problems - I think the last time was trying to </span><span class="c7">find the *perfect* lemon tart recipe combination</span><span>&nbsp;with crust and curd. Also, more recently doing a lot of </span><span class="c7">experiments with making gf crusts and desserts</span><span>. Some are definitely more successful than others. I&#39;m a bit more analog though - I still have a ton of handwritten recipe cards that I use - or a print out a recipe and store it with added notes in the recipe book. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I looked for awhile for a good recipe keeper app - like one that I could </span><span class="c7">save to via a bookmarklet and then go in and make notes or adjustments to things later</span><span>. But I never found anything. I always thought it would be pretty easy since most recipes are formatted in similar ways and you could reskin them into a different layout for in-app viewing. Maybe this is a good project for the three of us to collaborate on? :) Will work for ramen...</span></p><h2 class="c1 c10"><a name="h.btyx5nxq166f"></a><span>Jeremy Van Flee</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>Interview: Email</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I&#39;m not a great one to ask as I rarely follow recipes and just use them as inspiration, but I have created a spreadsheet (probably like yours!) to do the testing and compare ratios of ingredients in choc chip cookies.

I&#39;ve only done a few of them, but have wanted to have a party where we make </span><span class="c9">all</span><span>&nbsp;of the recipes and compare each cookie with scrutiny. </span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span>If its helpful at all to see how I thought about it, here it is:</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7Dux7MVTjsdHJrRzlRd3FNVUtSOEphbG14NExUdHc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7Dux7MVTjsdHJrRzlRd3FNVUtSOEphbG14NExUdHc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0</a></span></p><p class="c1 c5 c6"><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7Dux7MVTjsdHJrRzlRd3FNVUtSOEphbG14NExUdHc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0"></a></span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7Dux7MVTjsdHJrRzlRd3FNVUtSOEphbG14NExUdHc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0"></a></span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7Dux7MVTjsdHJrRzlRd3FNVUtSOEphbG14NExUdHc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0"></a></span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7Dux7MVTjsdHJrRzlRd3FNVUtSOEphbG14NExUdHc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0"></a></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span></span></p></body></html>
