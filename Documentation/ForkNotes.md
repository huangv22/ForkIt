# Meeting Notes 
Forkit meeting notes

## 5/3/2014
Location: KaffeHaus, SM

### Decisions Made:
* Start with Mobile Use Case

Top priorities to design for:
1. View Recipe/Ingredient List
2. Allow Editing and Versioning for Batches
3. Information Hierarchy for Notes/Tagline
4. Interation of how to navigate among batches in a diesh
5. View to Compare different batches

Location: Phone Call

### To Do
~~* Come up with user flows for base app
~~* Think of core features for v1 of app

### Notes
* Features
	* Each ingredient and cooking step should be its own line item
	* Each iteration of a recipe should have a notes section as a history of how the iteration turned out
	* Allow users to "watch" and "star" recipes so they can follow progress of a recipe, similar to Github
	* Be able to visualize diffs between recipes
	* Instead of pull request idea, do more of a push to share recipe with friends who are interested in your recipe.
	* "Fork" action allows users to take your recipe and add their personal flare on top of it or to enhance the existing base, which could be merged back into the main repo OR remain separate as a variation.

* Open Questions
	* Which media should we target? Desktop + Tablet? Depends on how people use the app - Recipe note-taking and documentation or as true recipe reference or both?
	
* Next Steps
	* We have a good base for features and user flow, so let's try to mockup some rough designs on how this app interface will be.
	* Ted - Will chat with my designer friend and run things by her to see what her thoughts and if she has ideas on the design
