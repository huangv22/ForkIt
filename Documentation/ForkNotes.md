# Meeting Notes
Forkit meeting notes

## 6/27/2014

### To Dos
* Design
** Information Hierarchy for Notes/Tagline
** Interation of how to navigate among batches in a dish
** View to Compare different batches
** Focus on transitiong between mockups

#### Recipe Detail functionality
## Must Haves
* Name
* Batch Number
* Overall recipe notes
* Action Items
** Start/Bookmarks
** New Batch
* Ingredients section
** Separate field for qty and item
** Add ingredient
** Action for each ingredient
*** Delete
*** Edit

* Recipe Section
** Steps are auto populated
** Add Steps
** Edit
** Delete Steps

## Nices to Have
* Ability to take and add a picture to the recipe
* Receipe: Move Steps on long tap

## Not Doing
* Recommendations
* No Social
* Dealing with measure words

## Requires User Testing (to validate use case)
*** Ability to comment on ingredient
*** Ability to substitute in line an ingredient for another (Requires Testing)

### Sharing
#### Ted Demo
* Clicking on new batch clones
* Edit functional exists for the cloned batch
* Need button to add an ingredient

#### Vince Demo
* Like buttons on top
* Mine/Yours recipe:
** Mine: Star
** Yours: Bookmark

### Decisions Made:
* Start with Mobile Use Case

Top priorities to design for:
1. View Recipe/Ingredient List
2. Allow Editing and Versioning for Batches
3. Information Hierarchy for Notes/Tagline
4. Interation of how to navigate among batches in a dish
5. View to Compare different batches

### To Do
~~* Come up with user flows for base app
~~* Think of core features for v1 of app

### Notes
* Features
	* Each ingredient and cooking step should be its own line item
	* Each iteration of a recipe should have a notes section as a history of how the iteration turned out
	* Allow users to "watch" and "star" recipes so they can follow progress of a recipe, similar to Github
	* Be able to visualize diffs between recipes
	* Instead of pull request idea, do more of a push to share recipe with friends who are interested in your recipe.
	* "Fork" action allows users to take your recipe and add their personal flare on top of it or to enhance the existing base, which could be merged back into the main repo OR remain separate as a variation.

* Open Questions
	* Which media should we target? Desktop + Tablet? Depends on how people use the app - Recipe note-taking and documentation or as true recipe reference or both?

* Next Steps
	* We have a good base for features and user flow, so let's try to mockup some rough designs on how this app interface will be.
	* Ted - Will chat with my designer friend and run things by her to see what her thoughts and if she has ideas on the design

Length: 1 Hour
Scribe: Vince

### To Do
* Rough sketch of what the interface will look like (VH + TL)
* Wireframes
* Requirements

### Notes
* Weekly meetings via call. Physical meeting once every two weeks
* Ted reached out to a few friends and received feedback.
	* Some people used spreadsheets
	* Others used analog
	* People are in pursuit of the *perfect* dish
* Vince shared feedback around Jacky
* Feature Idea:
	* Bookmarklet (HT: Sonja)
* Product Idea:
	* Start with the assumption that the user has already found a recipe.


### To Do

## 4/3/2014
Location: Gaslamp Cafe

### To Do
~~* Draft survey (Vince)~~
~~* Ask around peers (Vince + Ted)~~
~~* Create User Journey ~~

### Decisions Made:
* Probable beachhead to start further down the funnel somewhere around (2) Inspiration /(3) Recording experiments

### Notes
* Where to get started
	* Discussed three stages: (1) Selecting recipe, (2) Inspiration for tweaking, (3) Recording experiments
	* Select a niche dish
	* Reviewed GoogleTrends for interesting dish categories
	* Vince brought up the idea of using Google Consumer Surveys as a way of finding potential dish [topics](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=pasta%20recipe%2C%20ribs%20recipe%2C%20wings%20recipe&geo=US&cmpt=q)
* Positioning
	* Ted's CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) for Recipes
* Ted's Excellent Adventure
	* Finds a base recipe from a reliable source
	* Cooks it
	* Creates hypothesis of how to improve
	* Undergo second experiment

### To do
Priorities of Use Cases:
1) Recipe View
2) Versioning Interaction (How does CRUD work?)
3) Notes/Tagline Info Hierarchy
4) Navigating between Recipe Batches
5) Compare different batches (Diff View)

	* Recipe/Ingredient View:
		* "New Batch" button dupes original recipe and contains "Add Ingredient/Cooking Step" button
		* Making notes on original recipe and saving it, dupes it and creates new batch
